# Anki deck generator


Automatically generate anki decks using Amazon Polly to supply pronunciations.


## Requirements

* Python + Poetry
* An AWS account configured on your machine

Once Poetry is installed:

    poetry install
    poetry shell
    python main.py

This will create an apkg file that you can then load into Anki.

## Side goals

I want to try studying by going from English => Target Language
